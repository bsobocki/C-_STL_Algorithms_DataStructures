---passing by value---
(get the value once and use it in each time)

a = 3
b = 1

foo_a_val = 3
foo_b_val = 1

a = 2
b = 7

foo_a_val = 3
foo_b_val = 1

a = 5
b = 6

foo_a_val = 3
foo_b_val = 1

---passing by reference---
(get the reference of the variable and in each time get the value from the reference)

a = 90
b = 100

foo_a_ref = 90
foo_b_ref = 100

a = 2
b = 7

foo_a_ref = 2
foo_b_ref = 7

a = 23
b = 64

foo_a_ref = 23
foo_b_ref = 64
