vec = { 3, 4, 10, 11, 12, 42, 43, 56, 732, 578, 21, 453, 5, 7, 2, 4, 7, 4, 2, }

result of transform contains only values bigger or equal to 30: { 33, 34, 30, 31, 32, 32, 33, 36, 32, 38, 31, 33, 35, 37, 32, 34, 37, 34, 32, }

The next transform change vec to vector = { 3, 4, 0, 1, 2, 2, 3, 6, 2, 8, 1, 3, 5, 7, 2, 4, 7, 4, 2, }

And the last transform... now vec contains only squares of its own elements: { 9, 16, 0, 1, 4, 4, 9, 36, 4, 64, 1, 9, 25, 49, 4, 16, 49, 16, 4, }
